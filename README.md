# Agile Machine Learning with Scalding and scikit-learn

A talk delivered to [QCON San Francisco 2014](http://qconsf.com/tutorial/agile-machine-learning-scalding-and-scikit-learn).

## Prerequisites

- Working [Java](http://www.java.com/) installation (ideally, 1.7 and above)
- Python packages listed below. The easiest way to get them would be to use prepackaged distribution. 
  I use [Anaconda](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/) , 
  [Canopy](http://www.enthought.com/products/canopy) may work as well:
    - [iPython](http://ipython.org/) and prerequisites.
    - [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/) and prerequisites.
    - [mathplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) and prerequisites. On Mac, you should be careful to install the "framework version" so that `%mathplotlib inline` instruction with iPython notebook will work
- Few gigabytes of disk space

**Note** Anaconda is a big download (>1G), please prepare it in advance.

This is work in progress, please check back for more info.
